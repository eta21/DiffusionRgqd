Inference and Analysis for Generalized Quadratic Diffusions

## What is DiffusionRgqd?
__DiffusionRgqd__ is collection of tools for performing inference and analysis on scalar and bivariate time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes with quadratic drift and diffusion terms in R.

## Why use DiffusionRgqd?
__DiffusionRgqd__ provides a simple interface that requires minimal mathematical input in order to perform analysis on non-linear, time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes. The package also makes use of C++ in order to maximize the computational efficiency of inference routines. As such it is possible to conduct inference on a plethora of models in a desktop environment without incurring excessively long computation times.
